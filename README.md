# Sorting-Visualizer
Sorting Visualizer
A web application that visually demonstrates various sorting algorithms, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project provides an interactive platform for users to learn and understand how different sorting algorithms work by visualizing the sorting process step-by-step.

Introduction
Sorting Visualizer is a project that aims to simplify the learning process of sorting algorithms by providing a dynamic visual representation of how data is sorted. Sorting algorithms are fundamental in computer science, and understanding how they work is crucial for programming and algorithm design. This visualizer allows you to see how algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and others manipulate data step-by-step, making it easier to grasp the underlying mechanics.

Features
Interactive UI: Easily visualize the sorting process with a user-friendly interface.
Multiple Algorithms: Supports various sorting algorithms to visualize, each with unique characteristics.
Adjustable Speed: Control the speed of the visualization to observe the sorting process in detail or at a fast pace.
Customizable Array Size: Choose different array sizes to see how the algorithms handle varying amounts of data.
Real-time Visualization: Watch how elements are moved, compared, and swapped in real-time as the sorting algorithm progresses.
Live Demo

Technologies Used
HTML: Structure the webpage and create the elements that make up the visualizer.
CSS: Style the elements and layout to create an engaging and responsive user interface.
JavaScript: Implement the sorting algorithms and control the dynamic behavior of the visualization.
Installation
To run the Sorting Visualizer locally, follow these steps:

Alternatively, you can use a local web server to serve the files.

Usage
Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
Set the array size and speed using the provided sliders.
Click the "Generate New Array" button to create a new random array.
Press the "Start Sorting" button to visualize the sorting process.
Observe how the algorithm sorts the array step-by-step.
Sorting Algorithms Implemented
The following sorting algorithms are currently implemented in the visualizer:

Bubble Sort: A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
Selection Sort: An in-place comparison-based algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: a sorted and an unsorted region, repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted region and moving it to the sorted region.
Insertion Sort: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time, with the benefit of being more efficient than more complex algorithms for small data sets.
Merge Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the unsorted list into n sublists until each sublist contains a single element, and then merges these sublists to produce a sorted list.
Quick Sort: An efficient, in-place divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that selects a 'pivot' element from the array and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.
Heap Sort: Converts the array to a heap data structure, then repeatedly extracts the maximum element from the heap and rebuilds the heap until the array is sorted.
More algorithms may be added in future updates.
